  <para>The software used to create an LFS system is constantly being updated
  and enhanced. Security warnings and bug fixes may become available after
  the LFS book has been released. To check whether the package versions or
  instructions in this release of LFS need any modifications to accommodate
  security vulnerabilities or other bug fixes, please visit
  <ulink url="&errata;"/>
  before proceeding with your build. You should note any
  changes shown and apply them to the relevant section of the book as you
  progress with building the LFS system.</para>

  <para>In addition, the Linux From Scratch editors maintain a list of security
  vulnerabilities discovered after a book was released. To check whether there
  are any active security vulnerabilities, please visit
  <ulink url="&secadv;"/> prior to proceeding with your build. You should note
  any advisories and perform the steps to fix any security vulnerabilities as
  you progress with building the LFS system.</para>
